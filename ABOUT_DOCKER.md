### **Docker history** -> Container shipping history of **1950 year**

![old-cargo](img/old-cargo.jpeg)

* Before containerization, goods were usually handled manually as break [bulk cargo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Break_bulk_cargo)
* [Malcom McLean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcom_McLean) author of the container shipping revolution
* McLean knew "A ship earns money only when she's at sea", and based his business on that efficiency

### **Docker history** -> Container shipping history of **1950 year**

* Hand-loading a ship cost **$5.86 a ton** at that time
* Using containers, it cost only **16 cents a ton** to load a ship, **36-fold savings**
* Сontainerization reduced **the time it took to receive goods by 84%**

### **Docker history** -> Container shipping history
    
* Modern containers started in the Linux world, and are the product of an immense amount of work from a wide variety of people, over a long period of time
* Major technologies

### **Docker history** -> The birth of Docker

![solomon-hykes.jpg](img/solomon-hykes.jpg)

* The world **Docker** comes from a British colloquialism meanings **dock** work **er** - somebody who loads and unloads cargo from ships
* Docker [debuted in 5 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW9CAH9nSLs) to the public in Santa Clara at PyCon in 2013
* In six months, Docker open source repo received 6.7K+ stars on GitHub and 175 contributors
* In September 2013 dotCloud renamed to **Docker Inc.**
* Docker 1.0 was announced in June 2014 (stable)
* At the same time, Docker started moving towards being a complete platform
* As the potentials for Docker increased, the team decided to concentrate on it and sold off dotCloud to Berlin-based company CloudControl.
---

### **Docker history** -> Docker today

* Docker code writing in Golang - programming language from Google
* Open container initiative [OCI](https://www.opencontainers.org/). Born in a competition of standards between 
Docker Inc and [CoreOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_Linux)
    * The [image](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec) spec
    * The [runtime](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec) spec
    * The [distribution](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec) spec
* Starting from version 1.11 the Docker conforms to the OCI runtime spec
* Today Docker is estimated to be about **1BN $**. Last investment was 240M $ from Silicon Valley
* Docker Inc has somewhere in the region 300-400 employers
* The project [moby](https://github.com/moby/moby) have 56K+ stars on GitHub and 1.8K+ contributors
* The project [docker-ce](https://github.com/docker/docker-ce) have 3.8K+ stars on GitHub and 2K+ contributors

### Why docker born?

* Docker - is next evolution step of the **dotcloud evolution**.
  For understand this evolution we need understand main concept of the dotcloud.
  What the problems did dotcloud solve?

  * [Run](https://www.kencochrane.com/blog/2011/04/deploying-my-django-application-to-dotcloud/) application or **database** in the cloud cluster
  with [DSL](https://web.archive.org/web/20121106035252/http://docs.dotcloud.com/0.9/firststeps/quickstart)
  ([similar to modern docker commands](https://web.archive.org/web/20140925014838/http://docs.dotcloud.com/0.9/services/php/))
  * [zero-downtime pushes](https://web.archive.org/web/20121104220114/http://docs.dotcloud.com/0.9/firststeps/how-it-works/)
  * Scaling
  * Load balance
* **Why dotcloud want changes**?
  * dotcloud supported **only limited numbers of stacks** (like, php, python, nodejs, mssql etc)
  * dotcloud it is very complicated platform depends of the itself complicated cloud infrastructure
  * Not possible run specific application on the my infrastructure or laptop
* So, Solomon Hykes 

[//]: # (  * Need low-level piece for run anywhere, from laptop to ec2 or any server)
[//]: # (  * Need scale application, scheduling resources)

### Docker **concepts**

* **Lightweight**: Containers leverage and share the host kernel, 
making them much more efficient in terms of system resources than virtual machines.
    * Virtual machine have overhead - operation system. Run slowly. Have big image size. Operating system license required
    * Docker container runs natively on Linux and shares the kernel, without overhead. Very fast and ultra-portable
* **Build, share, and run** applications with containers
* **Flexible**: Even the most complex applications can be containerized.
* **Portable**: You can build locally, deploy to the cloud, and run anywhere.
* **Loosely coupled**: Containers are highly self sufficient and encapsulated, 
allowing you to replace or upgrade one without disrupting others.
* **Scalable**: You can increase and automatically distribute container replicas across a datacenter.
* **Secure**: Containers apply aggressive constraints and isolations to processes 
without any configuration required on the part of the user.

---

### Terminology
* **image** - **immutable** snapshot private filesystem
* **container** - isolation running process, networking with private filesystem
* **docker daemon** - background service
* **docker client** - command line tool that allows the user to interact with the daemon
* **Dockerfile**
* **docker hub** - default registry of Docker images
---

### Docker **architecture**
![architecture.jpg](img/architecture.jpg)
    
* Daemon (docker engine: cgroups, namespaces, capabilities, netlink, selinux, apparmor, chroot)
    * [Linux Containers LXC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LXC)
    * [libcontainer](https://github.com/docker/libcontainer)
    * [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc)
    * [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd)
* [CLI](https://github.com/docker/cli)
* [Registry (distribution)](https://github.com/docker/distribution) (storage of the images)

### Old Docker daemon **architecture**

### Current Docker daemon **architecture**

![current-acrhitecture.jpg](img/current-acrhitecture.jpg)
---

### **Dockerfile** commands syntax

* ```FROM``` ```FROM ubuntu:19.04``` [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/layers/ubuntu/library/ubuntu/19.04/images/sha256-a65d3401e785fbc3192f0046f68e6487134b70ec9ba79a956fecba9122b39378)
* ```RUN``` ```RUN ls -la .```
* ```WORKDIR``` ```WORKDIR /opt/my-app```
* ```COPY``` or ```ADD``` ```COPY package.json .```
* ```EXPOSE``` ```EXPOSE 80```
* ```ENTRYPOINT``` ```ENTRYPOINT dotnet my-app.dll```
* ```ENV``` ```ENV DB_PORT 3206```
* ```LABEL``` ```LABEL version="1.0"``` - for docker inspect, docker ps
---

### Docker **build context**

* ```docker context``` is not a **build context**
* What is context of the docker daemon?
    * File system cache
* What is the purpose of the Docker build context?
    * Because the client and daemon may not even run on the same machine
    * ```COPY```, ```ADD``` move files from context to result image 
* **with .git** folder ```Sending build context to Docker daemon 9.58MB```
* **without .git** folder ```Sending build context to Docker daemon  4.952MB```
* Build with different context type 
    * from filesystem ```docker build -t gs .```
    * from git ```docker build -t gs http://globalsearch.git```
    * from .tar.gz ```docker build -t gs globalsearch.tar.gz```
* ```.dockerignore``` - ignoring files that sending to build context
* **Warning**: Do not use your root directory, ```/```, as the ```PATH``` as it causes the build
 to transfer the entire contents of your hard drive to the Docker daemon.
---

### Docker **cache** 
* Lifecycle of the cache
    * ```ADD```, ```COPY``` - trigger calculate hash sum of the files in the build context (ignore date modified)  
    * ```RUN``` - not checking files in the image container, like ```RUN apt-get -y update``` [demo](examples/cache/Dockerfile)
* .dockerignore
    * **be careful** - always exclude ```.git``` ```.idea```, ```.DS_Store``` of mac os, etc.
    * [demo - exclude .DS_Store](.dockerignore)
---

### Docker **run container**
* binding ports ```docker run -d -p 8000:80 nginx```
* binding volumes ```docker run -d -v /tmp:/var/www nginx```
* links ```docker run --link myredis:redis debian env```
---

### Docker **network**
* ```docker network ls``` ```docker network inspect ...```
* ```traceroute 8.8.8.8```
---

### Docker **volumes**
* tmpfs
---

### Debugging **build of the Dockerfile**
* `--progress=plain`
